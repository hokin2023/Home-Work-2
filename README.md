# Homework #2

# Description

- My motivation was to learn and sharpen my coding skills using HTML/CSS
- I build this project because I could learn how to make a webpage adapt to smaller screen sizes when it's re-sized, how to distribute flex-boxes, and how to organize a webpage.
- It definitely solved how I could distribute the flex boxes evenly. I had no idea how to do it before and stuck there for hours.
- I learned lots of new elements and properties such as flex-basis, :: hover, media screen only, etc.

## Installation

- Cloned with github.
- Created assets folder, HTML, and CSS files.
- Organize how to distribute flex boxes.
- Copy images from Google.
- Used CSS to style the page and add links.
- Added README file.
- Git push everything to Github.
- Deployed application.

## Usage
